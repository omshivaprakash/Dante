# Dante - Book Tracker

Dante lets you manage all your books by simply scanning the ISBN barcode of the book. 
It will automatically grab all information from Googles book database. 
The app let's you arrange your books into 3 different categories, whether you 
have read the book, are currently reading the book or saved the book for later. So you 
can simply keep track of your progress of all your books and their current states.
